## [About this book](https://github.com/pedropark99/zig-book#about-this-book)

This is an open (i.e., open-source), technical and introductory book for the [Zig programming language](https://ziglang.org/), which is a new general purpose, and low-level programming language for building optimal and robust software.

Official repository of the book: [https://github.com/pedropark99/zig-book](https://github.com/pedropark99/zig-book).

This book is designed for both beginners and experienced developers. It explores the exciting world of Zig through small and simple projects (in a similar style to the famous "Python Crash Course" book from Eric Matthes). Some of these projects are: a Base64 encoder/decoder, a HTTP Server and an image filter.

As you work through the book, you will learn:

- The syntax of the language, and how it compares to C, C++ and Rust.
- Data structures, memory allocators, filesystem and I/O.
- Optionals as a new paradigm to handle nullability.
- How to test and debug a Zig application.
- Errors as values, and how to handle them.
- How to build C and Zig code with the build system that is embedded into the language.
- Zig interoperability with C.
- Parallelism with threads and SIMD.
- And more.
